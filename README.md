# solve-in-three
A coin-puzzle game where you are challenged to arrange a set of six coins into the shape of a hexagon following two simple rules.</br>
</br>
  Rule 1) You can only move a coin where it is adjacent to two or more coins.</br>
  Rule 2) You cannot move a coin if it is surrounded by other coins.</br>
